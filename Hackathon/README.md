It’s not a VMware {code} event if there isn’t a Hackathon! And this year will be no different. Our 5th annual Hackathon is right around the corner. On October 1 and 2nd, VMware {code} will be hosting a 2-day virtual, live, conference. <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/code/2020/08/20/vmware-code-connect-2020/">You can read more about the conference here</a> and <a href="https://code.vmware.com/home">register here.</a>

Unlike past years, we unfortunately cannot be together in the same room for one of my favorite events so this year’s logistics will be a little different. You will register for a topic and select your country/time zone once registration opens and you and your teams will be notified on September 20th and be allowed to work together on your project until October 2nd, where you will have your chance to present your project at CodeConnect to our judges!

<strong>Don’t know how to code? Don’t worry, there’s something to do on every team regardless of skill level!</strong>
