### <h2>Hackathon<h2>
</hr>
<h3>It‚Äôs not a VMware {code} event if there isn‚Äôt a Hackathon! And this year will be no different. Our 5th annual Hackathon is right around the corner. On October 1 and 2nd, VMware {code} will be hosting a 2-day virtual, live, conference. You can read more about the conference here and register here.</h3>
<br>
Unlike past years, we unfortunately cannot be together in the same room for one of my favorite events so this year‚Äôs logistics will be a little different.
<br><br> 
<b>Don‚Äôt know how to code? Don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs something to do on every team regardless of skill level!</b>
<br><br>

<h3>Captains:</h3>
<br>
This year, we‚Äôre recruiting captains for the Hackathon. A captain will be responsible for providing the team‚Äôs hackathon idea. Their idea will be added to our registration page (to open on Sept 7th) so that prospective participants can choose the captain whose idea & time zone suits their needs best! On Sept 20, Captains will be mailed the list of team members who signed up for their idea and it‚Äôs their responsibility to set up teams calls over the next few weeks. On October 2nd the captain or one of their team members will present their work to our judges who will score projects and award prizes! Interested or know someone interested? Please fill out <a href="URLHERE">this google form</a>!
<br><br>
<b>PLEASE NOTE: As a thank you for being a captain, we may or may not be sending a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù gift to captains who sign up üòâ</b>
