### **Time: 11:00-11:30AM PDT**
<div class="session-wrapper">
Code is for everybody! As the world moves toward containers and Kubernetes, the classic virtual infrastructure admin must modernize their skills. However, navigating the cloud native world can be extremely challenging for those from a classic infrastructure background. In this session, Patrick Kremer takes you through his 6-month journey from zero dev skills to open source contributor. Learn how you can also leverage the open source VMware Event Broker Appliance (VEBA) project to learn new developer skills while also improving your ability to respond to infrastructure events.<br>
