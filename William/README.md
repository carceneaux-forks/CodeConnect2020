### **vSphere and VMware Cloud on AWS Automation Live Coding**
### **Time: 1:30PM-3PM PDT**
<div class="session-wrapper">
Do you work with vSphere or VMware Cloud AWS and wish to automate a particular task that you have not been able to figure out? Maybe you are just getting started and looking for some tips or tools on how best to approach a specific problem? Perhaps you are already automating using either vSphere SOAP/REST API or VMware Cloud REST API but you are having issues looking for a specific API? If you have answered yes to any of these questions, this live coding session is for you. I will be using PowerShell/PowerCLI as a way to quickly prototype code during the session, so bring your question and letâ€™s write some code together to help solve your automation tasks!
