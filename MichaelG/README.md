### **Let's build a Kubernetes Operator in Go! w/ Michael Gasch**
### **Time: 11:00AM-12:30PM PDT**
<div class="session-wrapper">
"Kubernetes is quickly becoming the standard cloud API for deploying and managing modern workloads. 
Fundamentally, end-users express their desired state (application) state which is then reconciled by individual controllers in the platform. 
The beauty of this approach, besides its simplicity and robustness, is that it can be extended and used beyond the core Kubernetes types.
In fact, you can create your own APIs on top of Kubernetes for any resource by providing a custom controller logic to handle daily routine tasks or even complex lifecycle operations. 
This is also referred to as the ""operator pattern"". 

But how do you get started? What are the tools of the trade and basic primitives that you should understand before writing your first Kubernetes operator?
Even if you are not a (Go) developer, in this session we will walk you through the steps of creating your first operator from scratch by explaining the fundamentals of the Kubernetes platform
and applying our knowledge in a live coding session."
