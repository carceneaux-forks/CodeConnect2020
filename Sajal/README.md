### **Monitoring K8s and TKGI in Modern Datacenter w/ Sajal Debnath**
### **Time: 10:30-11:00AM PDT**
<div class="session-wrapper">
With the ever-increasing use of containerized applications, we see a significant proliferation of related technologies in modern datacenters. These latest technologies have brought newer responsibilities for the datacenter teams, for example, monitoring these environments for continuous operation and performance. Since the architecture of these related technologies is different hence their components and monitoring process is also different. One such example is VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated (TKGI), formerly known as Enterprise PKS. VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated or TKGI is a Kubernetes-based container solution with advanced networking, a private container registry, and life cycle management. TKGI simplifies the deployment and operation of Kubernetes clusters so you can run and manage containers at scale on private and public clouds. 

The question under consideration is what to monitor for in the deployed TKGI environment and how to monitor these. The next question is what to do or how to react to the issues we face in the monitored components.

This session will provide answers to all these questions. It will guide to what to monitor and how to monitor in a datacenter hosting TKGI environment. Also, this document provides best practices and general guidelines for monitoring such an environment. Though there are many ways we can monitor a TKGI environment, this document covers the VMware suite of products that is used to monitor TKGI environment including vRealize Network Insight, vRealize Operations Manager, and vRealize Log Insight.
